# EDA & Housing Market Dasboard

Analysis of the USA housing market performed using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Power BI for interactive data modeling and visualization.

**Status:** Ready  
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn), Power BI, DAX  
**Dataset:** USA Housing Dataset (Kaggle)

## Objective
To identify the primary drivers of real estate valuation and provide a business-ready tool for market analysis by:
- performing a rigorous Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand variable distributions and correlations,
- applying Feature Engineering in Python to create new efficiency metrics,
- implementing Data Modeling techniques in Power BI to handle continuous variables,
- and developing an interactive dashboard to visualize KPIs and market trends for decision-making.

## Project Content
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing raw datasets using Python.
- **Statistical Profiling:** Analysis of the target variable (`Price`) and its correlation with socioeconomic factors (Income, Area Age).
- **Analytics Engineering:** Transformation of continuous data into discrete categories (grouping) for better reporting usability.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Implementation of Slicers, Scatter Plots, and Trend Charts to explore the impact of neighborhood wealth on property value.
- **Advanced Metrics:** Creation of custom DAX measures to calculate market averages and performance indicators.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed (clean) CSV files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook with the full Python EDA and data transformation logic.
- `powerbi/`: Final `.pbix` file with the interactive dashboard and data model.
